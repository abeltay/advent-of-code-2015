> Note: All task input files are excluded from the repository with `.gitignore` â€“ we should not post them publicly, as Eric Wastl asks for: [Tweet](https://twitter.com/ericwastl/status/1465805354214830081).

# To run the scripts
2. Run `./prep.sh 01` with the day number appended. The example here is for Day 01
3. Run `./input.sh` to download the input file into the day's folder
4. Run `./run.sh` to run current day's file

## To set up cookie for `./input.sh`
1. Login to [AoC](https://adventofcode.com/)
2. Most requests should use your session cookie, copy it. It starts with "session=" until ";"
3. Put it into `cookie.txt`

## To test the template
1. Set day.txt to `template`
2. Uncomment the code block for part2
3. Run `./run.sh`
