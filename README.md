My attempt at <https://adventofcode.com/2015>

> Note: All task input files are excluded from the repository with `.gitignore` â€“ we should not post them publicly, as Eric Wastl asks for: [Tweet](https://twitter.com/ericwastl/status/1465805354214830081).

# To run the scripts
1. Put the session cookie in `cookie.txt`
2. Run `./prep.sh 01` with the day number appended. The example here is for Day 01
3. Run `./input.sh` to download the input file into the day's folder
4. Run `./run.sh` to run current day's file

## To test the template
1. Set day.txt to `template`
2. Uncomment the code block for part2
3. Run `./run.sh`
